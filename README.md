# MacOS Efficiency Mode in Windows
## If you are a windows lover just like me and can't be able to switch to Mac yet for that reason then I can help you achieving almost same Mac like performance in your windows machine hehe.

### Let's go step by step

## Performance mode

- Open Search and Type Power Options
- Select Create a Power Plan & Name it as you want ( Mac Efficiency Mode in my Case )
- Now create it and click Change Advanced Power Settings
- Set Processor Power Management both Minimum and Maximum (Battery & Plugged) state to 100%.
- Set AMD Power Slider both On Battery & Plugged in to Best Performance.
- Set AMD Graphics Power Settings -> AMD Powerplay Settings to Maximize Performance (Both Battery & Plugged)
- Now save the new profile and active it.
- Go to System -> Power & Battery and set Power mode to Best Performance.
- Now all set, just restart once your laptop and you're good to go.

## Audio mode
- If you're having low sounded laptop then just install FxSound & boom you'll get 3x audio increasing solution with just a click.
- Download link https://www.fxsound.com/

## Appearance mode
- Download RoundedTB for making the taskbar like macOS and it's Microsoft own app
- Download link https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/roundedtb/9MTFTXSJ9M7F

## Pros
- You'll get same performance just like while your laptop is plugged in. The main reason why we love Macs.

## Cons
- It'll drain your laptops battery 2x faster so only active this mode when it needs for some heavy task and you don't have access your laptop charger and nearby line.


### PS: Discovered this features a year ago or maybe more but hoped it would help you just like doing mine so share it.
